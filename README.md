You can use copy to automatically copy that call to your clipboard. 

### Search Feature ###

As a note, if you search, and make a typo, you will need to clear the search bar and search again

- Event Builder as an expanded stand-alone-tool for customers/staff, with an emphasis on usability for non technical users.
- More Q3 Commands
- Automatic copying of links to the clipboard in the "links" tab, if desired by p
